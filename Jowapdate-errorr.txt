Problem: I cant connect to devices using given code

Initial Idea:
my first idea is to use websocket and create a room when a user register and it will generate code from the backend, 
then when the other user register and also generate code, it will create its own room. Then when they decided to connect to each other,
the other user will leave the room and join the other user.
