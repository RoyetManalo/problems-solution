Problem: I can't find a solution on how to create a coooldown on each button.

Initial idea: 
My first idea is to grab what element was clicked using event.target, then disabled it using element.disabled, then create a
setTimeout for 30 secs and enabled the element after 30 secs. It works but i dont know if its the best solution. I try to add
some cooldown number that countdown every second, it works but every button has the same cooldown value because it came from the data
function in vue. So I was thinking that I need to use a scoped variable, but It will not be reactive.
