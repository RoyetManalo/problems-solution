Problem: I can't find a solution on how to create a coooldown on each button.

Initial idea: 
My first idea is to grab what element was clicked using event.target, then disabled it using element.disabled, then create a
setTimeout for 30 secs and enabled the element after 30 secs. It works but i dont know if its the best solution. I try to add
some cooldown number that countdown every second, it works but every button has the same cooldown value because it came from the data
function in vue. So I was thinking that I need to use a scoped variable, but It will not be reactive.


Problem: Cannot set headers after they are sent to the client


Problem: Button does not cooldown
Reason: I've used event.target then when I click on the icon or text it doesnt work

Solution: After the data got fetch from the server add 2 properties for each object of the attack monster. Add the ff. properties
isDisabled: false, cd: 30. You can use the isDisabled properties to set the :disabled property of a button and then use the cd 
property to create a countdown of a cooldown every second. After the cd value becomes 0. just reset it the its original value
